    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>  I am Suchitra Sahu, currently finishing my B.E Electronics and Instrumentation 
         at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Hyderabad. I have got hands-on experience 
         with designing and I am very much interested in programming. I do have prior experience in coding
         and programming but I also want to enhance my skills. I am very much interested in learning 
         game-making. I am a dedicated and detail-oriented individual looking for an entry-level position
         at a well-reputed organization to broaden my exposure and experience and a 
         place where I can improve my knowledge, abilities, and experience while also enhancing 
         the organization's success.

    <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
    <p> <h3>Research Intern, Military College of Electronics and Mechanical Engineering</h3>        
            May 2023 - Jul 2023 · 3 mos , On-site 
            <ul>
                <li>Project "Target Classification of Radar using Deep Learning" aims to develop an
                    advanced system that leverages deep learning techniques to accurately classify targets
                    detected by radar systems.</li>
                <li>Radar technology plays a crucial role in various domains, 
                    including defense, aviation, and meteorology. By applying deep learning algorithms 
                    to radar data, this project seeks to enhance the ability to distinguish between 
                    different types of targets, such as vehicles, or natural objects, with higher precision
                    and efficiency.</li>
                <li>The system will involve preprocessing and feature extraction of radar data,
                    followed by training deep neural networks on labeled target samples to learn discriminative
                    patterns.</li>
                <li>The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable and automated solution for real-time
                    target classification in radar systems, enabling improved situational awareness and 
                    decision-making in various applications.</li>
